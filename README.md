## **Usage**

Code tested with python 3.10 (should work with 3.7+)

1. Clone repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Dodgemaster1/CopyTelegramChannel.git
```

2. Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd CopyTelegramChannel
```

3. Install requirements (it's better to use a virtual environment):

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Set api_id and api_hash in config.py (you can get it [here](https://my.telegram.org/apps))

5. Run the script and follow the instructions:

```bash
python main.py
```
